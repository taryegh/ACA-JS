Write the destructuring assignment that reads:

years property into the variable age.
isAdmin property into the variable isAdmin(false, if no such property)
Hereâ€™s an example of the values after your assignment: */

/* let salaries = {
  "John": 100,
  "Pete": 300,
  "Mary": 250

Create the function topSalary(salaries) that returns the name of the top - paid person.

If there are multiple top - paid persons, return any of them.
P.S.Use Object.entries and destructuring to iterate over key / value pairs. */
