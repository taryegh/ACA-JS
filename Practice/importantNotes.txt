There are 7 basic data types in JavaScript.

- number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point.
- string for strings. A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
- boolean for true/false.
- null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
- undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
- object for more complex data structures.
- symbol for unique identifiers.
